I recently joined the [WEST Career Accelerator program](https://www.joinwest.org/mentorship/career-accelerator-program) for 2024. While not officially part of the program, accelerator participants were invited to participate in the [WEST Leadership Summit](https://2024westsummit.splashthat.com/). 

The summit was a great experience unlike any other conference I have participated in. I left feeling motivated and inspired. I was so inspired that I decided to give myself an additional challenge. I'm going to document my learning throughout the accelerator program, and I'm going to share those learnings *publicly* here on website.

Why did I set myself this goal?
* Writing about what I learn will help me retain the information, as well as giving myself something to refer to in the future.
* Committing to a schedule (at least one post per event) gives me some structure and accountability.
* Posting publicly here rather than on social media will be a nice little technical growth project. I've already learned a bit about Ruby, Jekyll, and GitHub Pages in setting up this blog.
* Maybe some day someone else will find this helpful.

I'm looking forward to intentional focus on career growth!
