I am a software engineer with over 15 year of experience, primarily building web services. I have spent much of my career so far at early stage startups and I enjoy the breadth of skills it requires. I am currently a Staff Software Engineer at [Grow Therapy](https://www.growtherapy.com), working to make therapy more accessible. 

You can see more details about my previous jobs on my [resume](assets/web_resume.pdf).

I am an organizer for [Madison Women in Tech](https://madisonwomen.tech/), a supportive, inclusive community that empowers and elevates women and nonbinary folks in the Madison, WI tech scene.

I enjoy sharing my knowledge and have given a handful of talks at local meetups and conferences. You can find slides for those talks on my [talks page](/talks). 

When I am not making things with computers, I enjoy making things with my hands, primarily through various fiber arts.
