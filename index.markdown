I am a software engineer with a decade of experience, primarily building web services. I have spent much of my career so far at early stage startups and I enjoy the breadth of skills it requires. I am currently a Staff Software Engineer at [Grow Therapy](https://www.growtherapy.com), working to make therapy more accessible. 

You can see more details about my previous jobs on my [resume](assets/web_resume.pdf).

I work with various organizations to help increase the diversity of the software engineering field. Including:
* co-organizer for [Codecinella](https://codecinella.org), a Madison WI based meetup looking to strengthen our community, and to encourage more women and non-binary folks to become involved in the technology field.
* co-organizer for [DevFestWI](https://www.devfestwi.com/), a positive, inclusive conference for all technologists.
* former intern manager for [Maydm](https://www.maydm.org/)

I enjoy sharing my knowledge and have given a handful of talks at local meetups and conferences. You can find slides for those talks on my [talks page](/talks).
